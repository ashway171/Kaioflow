## About Kaioflow

Kaioflow takes a radical approach to productivity: once you start a focus session, there's no going back. Selected apps are completely inaccessible until your timer expires—no overrides, no exceptions, no mercy. 

**Core Features**:
- **Irreversible blocking**: Apps stay blocked until session completion
- **Custom time periods**: Set your own focus duration
- **Zero-compromise design**: No emergency exits or workarounds

## Why Kaioflow Changes Everything

**The Problem with "Flexible" Productivity Apps:**
Every other app gives you an escape hatch. A "just this once" button. They're designed for people who want to *feel* productive, not *be* productive.

**The Kaioflow Difference:**
- **No negotiation with your future self**: That voice saying "just 5 minutes on Instagram" gets silenced before it starts
- **Authentic commitment**: Your word to yourself finally means something
- **Real consequences**: The same way you can't un-send an email, you can't un-block apps mid-session

**What This Actually Gives You:**
- **Laser-focused work sessions** that go deeper than you thought possible
- **Complete elimination of temptations** from social media, games, and time-wasting apps
- **Real discipline building** through distraction-free time management that sticks
- Self-respect that comes from keeping promises to yourself

## The Philosophy

Other productivity apps treat you like you can't be trusted with your own decisions. Kaioflow treats you like an adult—one who's made a commitment and means to keep it.  

**Sometimes, the most productive thing you can do is remove your own ability to be unproductive.**
